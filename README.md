# Unity-XR-Oculus-Android-Starter-Project

This is a template that has Raycasting on both controllers + Grabbing working using XR Interactions.

Build directly to device using Build and Run.
Editor version - 2021.3.0f1 (Should run other with 2021.3 versions)
In case project settings dont load well for you, look at the images in this git to set the project up properly. 

For Oculus Setup, best way is to Install Unity Editor with Android SDK, enabling developer mode on Oculus Mobile app, enabling developer mode on Oculus Android settings, and connecting Oculus to PC using cable. 
Oculus Developer Hub can be used to make adb stuff easier, simply install ODH, when prompted for switching ADB versions, select the Unity Editor ADB and do 'Change ADB Path'. Once done, Your Oculus should show up in devices when you have it connected to PC using cable. Now, you can check 'ADB over WiFi' and unplug the headset to continue developing wirelessly. [This is an ADB feature, but ODH is pretty nice]. 

Alternatively, if you switch platform to Windows/Macos, you can use Oculus Link using the Oculus Desktop app (different from ODH) to directly run the game on your Oculus when you enter Game Mode in Unity.

The only difference is that I combined his tutorials and did not use his Github template. I also am using the latest recommended Unity version as of right now, which means that I am also using the release version of XR Interaction Toolkit, where the template from this channel uses the preview version of the same.

Let me know if this template has helped you, and star the project.
